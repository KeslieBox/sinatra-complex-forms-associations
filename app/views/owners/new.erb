  <%# -checkbox has a `name` of `"owner[pet_ids][]"` so we can structure our `params` 
  hash such that the array of pet IDs is stored inside the `"owner"` hash. We are 
  aiming to associate the pets that have these IDs with the new owner. 
  -checkbox has a `value` of the given pet's ID so that when that checkbox is 
  selected, its value, i.e., the pet's ID, is what gets sent through to the `params` hash.
  -checkbox has an `id` of the given pet's ID so that our Capybara test
  can find the checkbox using the pet's ID.
  -in between the opening and closing input tags, we use ERB to render
  the given pet's name.%>
